My take on the idea of "50 Projects in 50 days" except with simple algorithms.<br/><br/>


**Selection Sort** - Selects the smallest value in the list and moves it into index 0, index 0 is then excluded from the next sorting recursion so that the algorithm can select the 2nd smallest value and move it into index 1. Now index 0 and index 1 is excluded from the list in order for the algorithm to find the 3rd smallest value of the list. The final product will be a sorted list with value from smallest to largest. <br/><br/>
**Bubble Sort** - The algorithm starts with values in index 0 and index 1, if value in index 1 is smaller than value in index 0, then the value in index 1 switches with value in index 0, the algorithm will continue to swap values in index[i] with index[i+1] until the final list is sorted from smallest value to largest value. This recursion sort can repeat multiple times until final sorting is done.
